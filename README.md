# CTZN Extended ("CTZN" pronounced "Citizen")

CTZN is a decentralized social network with a strong focus on building communities initally created by Paul Frazee, CTZN Extended is a new fork created by early CTZN user, Joe Harley, to teach himself about JavaScript and improve upon the original CTZN platform (think what C++ is to C!)

**Standard CTZN Features**

- Status feeds with 256 character limits but the ability to post "extended text" with no limit (shows on expand).
- Social following and moderated communities.
- Threaded comments.
- Decentralized hosting (anybody can create a server, and data syncs using the [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org)).

Read the [initial design document](./docs/design.md) to learn more about the architecture.
